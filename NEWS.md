# bvhar (development version)

* Use Signal Adaptive Variable Selector (SAVS) to generate sparse coefficient from shrinkage priors.

* `var_bayes()` and `vhar_bayes()` now handle both shrinkage priors and stochastic volatility.

* `bvar_ssvs()`, `bvar_horseshoe()`, `bvar_sv()`, `bvhar_ssvs()`, `bvhar_horseshoe()`, and `bvhar_sv()` are deprecated, and will be removed in v2.1.0 with their source functions.

* `set_horseshoe()` has additional setting for `group_shrinkage`. Horseshoe sampling now has additional group shrinkage level parameters.

* `set_ssvs()` now additionally should specify different Beta hyperparameters for each own-lag and cross-lag.

## New priors

* `set_dl()` specifies Dirichlet-Laplace (DL) prior in `var_bayes()` and `vhar_bayes()`.

* `set_ng()` specifies Normal-Gamma (NG) prior in `var_bayes()` and `vhar_bayes()`.

* MCMC functions return give `$param` and `$param_names`, not individual `$*_record` members.

* `bvar_sv()` and `bvhar_sv()` supports hierarchical Minnesota prior.

## Internal changes

* Added regularization step in internal Normal posterior generation function against non-existing LLT case.

* Added `BOOST_DISABLE_ASSERTS` flag against `boost` asserts.

## Spillover effects

* `spillover()` computes static spillover given model.

* `dynamic_spillover()` computes dynamic spillover given model.

## Forecasting SV models

* `predict()`, `forecast_roll()`, and `forecast_expand()` with SV models can use CI level when adding sparsity.

* `predict()`, `forecast_roll()`, and `forecast_expand()` of `svmod` have `sparse` option to use sparsity.

* Out-of-sample forecasting functions are now S3 generics (`forecast_roll()` and `forecast_expand()`).

* Add Rolling-window forecasting for SV models (`forecast_roll.svmod()`).

* Add Expanding-window forecasting for SV models (`forecast_expand.svmod()`).

* When forecasting SV models, it is available to choose whether to use time-varying covariance (`innovation` option, which is `TRUE` by default).

* `forecast_roll()` and `forecast_expand()` can implement OpenMP multithreading, except in `bvarflat` class.

* `sim_mniw()` output format has been changed into list of lists.

* Now can use MNIW generation by including header (`std::vector<Eigen::MatrixXd> sim_mn_iw(...)`).

* Compute LPL inside `forecast_roll.svmod()` and `forecast_expand.svmod()` using `lpl` option.

* Instead, `lpl` method is removed.

# bvhar 2.0.1

* Fix internal vectorization and unvectorization behavior.

* Used Eigen 3.4 feature (`reshaped()`) to solve these (`RcppEigen >= 0.3.4.0.0`).

# bvhar 2.0.0

* Start to implement OOP in C++ source for each model, ready for major update.

* Add SV specification (`sv_spec` argument) in `bvhar_sv()` and `bvar_sv()` (`set_sv()`).

* Prevent SSVS overflow issues by using log-sum-exp trick when computing Bernoulli posterior probability.

* Add separate constant term prior specification (`intercept`) in `bvhar_sv()` and `bvar_sv()` (`set_intercept()`).

* Convert every header file inst/include to header-only format. This enables external inclusion of our classes, structs, and Rcpp functions by using `LinkingTo` (in R package development) or `// [[Rcpp::depends(RcppEigen, BH, bvhar)]]`.

## Parallel Chain MCMC

* Use OpenMP parallel for loop

* Progress bar will show the status only for master thread when OpenMP enabled.

* Interruption detect will just save values and break the loop, not return immediately.

* Do burn-in and thinning in each `returnRecords()` method to make pre-process parallel chains easier.

* Use boost library (`BH` package) RNG instead of Rf_* RNG of `Rcpp` for thread-safety.

* Introduce function overloading to internal Rcpp random generation functions temporarily.
It's for maintaining `set.seed()` usage of some functions.

# bvhar 1.2.0

* Replace progress bar of `RcppProgress` package with custom header (`bvharprogress.h`).

* Replace checking user interruption in the same package with custom header (`bvharinterrupt.h`).

* Fix triangular algorithm. Found missing update of some variables (`bvar_sv()` and `bvhar_sv()`).

# bvhar 1.1.0

* For new research, add new features for shrinkage priors.

* Add Shrinkage priors SSVS and Horseshoe (`bvar_ssvs()`, `bvhar_ssvs()`, `bvar_horseshoe()`, and `bvhar_horseshoe()`).

* `bvar_sv()`, `bvhar_sv()` works with SSVS (`set_ssvs()`) and Horseshoe (`set_horseshoe()`).

* Update the shrinkage structure in the spirit of Minnesota. (`minnesota = TRUE`, `minnesota = c("no", "short", "longrun")`).

* Stochastic volatility models implement corrected triangular algorithm of Carriero et al. (2021).
